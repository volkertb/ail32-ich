# ail32-ich

An attempt to develop an AIL/32 (protected mode DOS) sound driver for Intel ICHx and compatible integrated sound
devices. Based on the AIL/32 sources developed and released by John Miles and the
[ichplayer](https://github.com/volkertb/ich2player) sources by jeff Leyda.

With thanks to GitHub user Wohlstand for [forking the AIL/32 sources on GitHub and providing a Makefile that allows the
AIL/32 sources to be built with an open-source toolchain](https://github.com/Wohlstand/ail32-sandbox).

**NOTE**: This is still a work in progress.

## How to build

Run the following command:

```shell
./build.sh
```
