# License terms of the original AIL/32 source code

John Miles shared a [link to the source code](http://www.thegleam.com/ke5fx/misc/AIL2.ZIP) on
[his website](http://www.ke5fx.com/). In the ZIP file, he included a README file with the following terms:

> This package contains the real mode (AIL V2.14) and 32-bit protected-mode DOS
(AIL/32 V1.05) versions of the IBM Audio Interface Library (AIL).  AIL V2.14
and AIL/32 were the predecessors to the current Miles Sound System package
published by RAD Game Tools (http://www.radgametools.com).
>
> As of May 26, 2000, all source code and compiled object code in this package
may be considered "open-source freeware," usable by anyone for any purpose,
commercial or otherwise, without restriction or limitation.  I strongly
encourage, but do not require, anyone who adds any further value to this
package to release their modifications and improvements under the same terms.
>
>I expressly disclaim any liability for bugs, defects, or intellectual-property
violations that may arise as a consequence of using the contents of this
package for any purpose, commercial or otherwise.  Use at your own risk!
